This is a library and generic interface for alternative random
generators in Python and NumPy.

## New Features

The the [development documentation](https://bashtage.github.io/randomgen/change-log.html) for the latest features,
or the [stable documentation](https://bashtage.github.io/randomgen/devel/change-log.html) for the latest released features.


# WARNINGS

## Changes in v1.19

``Generator`` and ``RandomState`` have been officially deprecated, and will
warn with a ``FutureWarning`` about their removal. They will also receive virtually
no maintenance. It is now time to move to NumPy's ``np.random.Generator`` which has
features not in ``randomstate.Generator`` and is maintained more actively.

A few distributions that are not present in ``np.random.Generator`` have been moved
to ``randomstate.ExtendedGenerator``:

* `multivariate_normal`: which supports broadcasting
* `uintegers`: fast 32 and 64-bit uniform integers
* `complex_normal`: scalar complex normals

There are no plans to remove any of the bit generators, e.g., ``AESCounter``,
``ThreeFry``, or ``PCG64``. 

## Changes in v1.18

There are many changes between v1.16.x and v1.18.x. These reflect API
decision taken in conjunction with NumPy in preparation of the core
of `randomgen` being used as the preferred random number generator in
NumPy. These all issue `DeprecationWarning`s except for `BasicRNG.generator`
which raises `NotImplementedError`. The C-API has also changed to reflect
the preferred naming the underlying Pseudo-RNGs, which are now known as
bit generators (or `BigGenerator`s).

## Future Plans

A substantial portion of randomgen has been merged into NumPy. Revamping NumPy's random
number generation was always the goal of this project (and its predecessor
[NextGen NumPy RandomState](https://github.com/bashtage/ng-numpy-randomstate>)),
and so it has succeeded.

While I have no immediate plans to remove anything, after a 1.19 release I will:

* Remove `Generator` and `RandomState`. These duplicate NumPy and will diverge over time.
  The versions in NumPy are authoritative. **Deprecated**
* Preserve novel methods of `Generator` in a new class, `ExtendedGenerator`. **Done**
* Add some distributions that are not supported in NumPy. _Ongoing_
* Add any interesting bit generators I come across. _Recent additions include the DXSM and CM-DXSM variants of PCG64 and the LXM generator._


## Python 2.7 Support

v1.16 is the final major version that supports Python 2.7. Any bugs
in v1.16 will be patched until the end of 2019. All future releases
are Python 3, with an initial minimum version of 3.5.

# Features

* Designed as a replacement for NumPy's 1.16's RandomState

  ```python
  from randomgen import Generator, MT19937
  rnd = Generator(MT19937())
  x = rnd.standard_normal(100)
  y = rnd.random(100)
  z = rnd.randn(10,10)
  ```

* Default random generator is a fast generator called Xoroshiro128plus
* Support for random number generators that support independent streams
  and jumping ahead so that sub-streams can be generated
* Faster random number generation, especially for normal, standard
  exponential and standard gamma using the Ziggurat method

  ```python
  from randomgen import Generator
  # Default bit generator is Xoroshiro128
  rnd = Generator()
  w = rnd.standard_normal(10000)
  x = rnd.standard_exponential(10000)
  y = rnd.standard_gamma(5.5, 10000)
  ```

* Support for 32-bit floating randoms for core generators.
  Currently supported:

  * Uniforms (`random`)
  * Exponentials (`standard_exponential`, both Inverse CDF and Ziggurat)
  * Normals (`standard_normal`)
  * Standard Gammas (via `standard_gamma`)

  **WARNING**: The 32-bit generators are **experimental** and subject
  to change.

  **Note**: There are _no_ plans to extend the alternative precision
  generation to all distributions.

* Support for filling existing arrays using `out` keyword argument. Currently
  supported in (both 32- and 64-bit outputs)

  * Uniforms (`random`)
  * Exponentials (`standard_exponential`)
  * Normals (`standard_normal`)
  * Standard Gammas (via `standard_gamma`)

* Support for Lemire's method of generating uniform integers on an
  arbitrary interval by setting `use_masked=True`.

## Included Pseudo Random Number Generators

This module includes a number of alternative random
number generators in addition to the MT19937 that is included in NumPy.
The RNGs include:

* Cryptographic cipher-based random number generator based on AES, ChaCha20, HC128 and Speck128.
* [MT19937](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/numpy/random/mtrand/),
 the NumPy rng
* [dSFMT](http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/SFMT/) a
  SSE2-aware version of the MT19937 generator that is especially fast at
  generating doubles
* [xoroshiro128+](http://xoroshiro.di.unimi.it/),
  [xorshift1024*Ï†](http://xorshift.di.unimi.it/),
  [xoshiro256**](http://xorshift.di.unimi.it/),
  and [xoshiro512**](http://xorshift.di.unimi.it/)
* [PCG64](http://www.pcg-random.org/)
* ThreeFry and Philox from [Random123](https://www.deshawresearch.com/resources_random123.html)

## Differences from `numpy.random.RandomState`

### Note
These comparisons are relative to NumPy 1.16. The project has been
substantially merged into NumPy 1.17+.

### New Features relative to NumPy 1.16

* `standard_normal`, `normal`, `randn` and `multivariate_normal` all
  use the much faster (100%+) Ziggurat method.
* `standard_gamma` and `gamma` both use the much faster Ziggurat method.
* `standard_exponential` `exponential` both support an additional
  `method` keyword argument which can be `inv` or
  `zig` where `inv` corresponds to the current method using the inverse
  CDF and `zig` uses the much faster (100%+) Ziggurat method.
* Core random number generators can produce either single precision
  (`np.float32`) or double precision (`np.float64`, the default) using
  the optional keyword argument `dtype`
* Core random number generators can fill existing arrays using the
  `out` keyword argument
* Standardizes integer-values random values as int64 for all platforms.
* `randint` supports generating using rejection sampling on masked
  values (the default) or Lemire's method.  Lemire's method can be much
  faster when the required interval length is much smaller than the
  closes power of 2.

### New Functions

* `random_entropy` - Read from the system entropy provider, which is
  commonly used in cryptographic applications
* `random_raw` - Direct access to the values produced by the underlying
  PRNG. The range of the values returned depends on the specifics of the
  PRNG implementation.
* `random_uintegers` - unsigned integers, either 32- (`[0, 2**32-1]`)
  or 64-bit (`[0, 2**64-1]`)
* `jump` - Jumps RNGs that support it.  `jump` moves the state a great
  distance. _Only available if supported by the RNG._
* `advance` - Advanced the RNG 'as-if' a number of draws were made,
  without actually drawing the numbers. _Only available if supported by
  the RNG._

## Status

* Builds and passes all tests on:
  * Linux 32/64 bit, Python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7
  * Linux (ARM/ARM64), Python 3.7
  * OSX 64-bit, Python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7
  * Windows 32/64 bit, Python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7
  * FreeBSD 64-bit

## Version

The package version matches the latest version of NumPy where
`RandomState(MT19937())` passes all NumPy test.

## Documentation

Documentation for the latest release is available on
[my GitHub pages](http://bashtage.github.io/randomgen/). Documentation for
the latest commit (unreleased) is available under
[devel](http://bashtage.github.io/randomgen/devel/).


## Requirements
Building requires:

* Python (3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8)
* NumPy (1.14, 1.15, 1.16, 1.17, 1.18, 1.19)
* Cython (0.27+)
* tempita (0.5+), if not provided by Cython

Testing requires pytest (4.0+).

**Note:** it might work with other versions but only tested with these
versions.

## Development and Testing

All development has been on 64-bit Linux, and it is regularly tested on
Travis-CI (Linux/OSX), Appveyor (Windows), Cirrus (FreeBSD) and Drone.io
(ARM/ARM64 Linux).

Tests are in place for all RNGs. The MT19937 is tested against
NumPy's implementation for identical results. It also passes NumPy's
test suite where still relevant.

## Installing

Either install from PyPi using

```bash
pip install randomgen
```

or, if you want the latest version,

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/bashtage/randomgen.git
```

or from a cloned repo,

```bash
python setup.py install
```

### SSE2

`dSFTM` makes use of SSE2 by default.  If you have a very old computer
or are building on non-x86, you can install using:

```bash
python setup.py install --no-sse2
```

### Windows

Either use a binary installer, or if building from scratch, use
Python 3.6/3.7 with Visual Studio 2015/2017 Community Edition. It can also
be build using Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7 and
Python 2.7.

## Using

The separate generators are importable from `randomgen`

```python
from randomgen import Generator, ThreeFry, PCG64, MT19937
rg = Generator(ThreeFry())
rg.random(100)

rg = Generator(PCG64())
rg.random(100)

# Identical to NumPy
rg = Generator(MT19937())
rg.random(100)
```
